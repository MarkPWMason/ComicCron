# Comics CRON

## How this works
Sets up the fetch and links it to the Database. Will fetch all the Marvel characters at 12:01 everyday which then stores the results into an array which then gets sent to the database.

## How this fits into the Marvel API system
This fits into the Marvel API because I incorporate this into the type ahead system which then allows for me to search for characters into the search bar and they appear in the drop down with all the results that match.

## How to set this up
create .env
npm install

## How to use this
it runs at 12:01 and when its launched
